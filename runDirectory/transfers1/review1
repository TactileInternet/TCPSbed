An End To End Tactile Cyber Physical System Design

has been accepted for presentation at EITEC 2018 @CPSWeek and publication as a full paper (16 pages). This year we received 7 submissions. After discussions among the chairs of the PC, we accepted 4 papers. Addtionally, we will have a keynote presentation by Prof. Holger Schlingloff from 'Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin'.

We enclose the reviews for your paper. Please make sure to take into account the comments of the reviewers when preparing the camera-ready version of your paper (in addition to carefully proof-reading it for typos and other minor problems).

The workshop program will be announced at the workshop website in the following weeks. We plan for a very interactive event equally involving participants with and without an accepted paper.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

- At least one of the paper's authors must register to the workshop not later then +++ March, 16th +++.
- The Deadline for the camera-ready Version is also ++ March, 16th +++. This Deadline is strict as we now have a tight schedule. Please be aware that the camera-ready papers must be conform to the LNCS publishing guidelines. Author guidelines and templates are available on Springer's author information page.

Congratulations once again and we look forward to seeing you at EITEC 2018 in Porto.

Best regards,
Andreas, Ingo, Thorsten, and Wolfgang

PAPER: 1
TITLE: An End To End Tactile Cyber Physical System Design
AUTHORS: Arjun N, Ashwin S M, Kurian Polachan, Prabhakar T V and Chandramani Singh

Overall evaluation: 2 (accept)

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The paper gives a detailed description of the design and implementation of a system which the authors call "Tactile Cyber Physical Systems" (TCPS), consisting of a tactile glove that records the movements of the operator's hand and controls a remote robot arm. The contribution of the paper is the design and implementation of the TCPS.

The algorithms for computing the necessary spacial coordinates of the gloves are shown in chapter 2.1. However I would assume that these algorithms are not a contribution from the authors but taken from other literature. This should be stated clearly in the paper and an appropriate reference should be given.

While the implementation of the system is described in detail there is no or very little information provided why certain design decisions have been made (e.g. why certain components have been choosen) and what would have been possible alternatives. A discussio of these design alternatives couls have improved the paper. There are some suggestions to improve the performance of the system in the conclusion chapters. However still no measurements and quantiative data is provided.

Minor things that could be improved:
- the calculated delay in figure 7 should not be denoted as end-to-end delay, as it combines 2 use cases. It would be better to separate them in the usecase E2E delay of hand movement till robot action and a second use case of sensing tactial data until vibration of the ERM motors.
- Delay of the computing algorithms: As the calculation SW runs in a 10ms loop these 10ms need to be added to the computation time to provied a real worst case latency.



As the paper provides a very interesting and detailed decription of the implementation of the glove and the robot it is a good contribution for the workshop that might create multiple discussions. Therefore I would recomend to accept the contribution. Maybe the authores can arrange a short demo of their system during their presentation.

Overall evaluation: -1 (weak reject)

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
This paper presents an end-to-end approach (so called tactile CPS) that allows an operator using a robot arm remotely to perform task through a glove and video.

This paper deals with a interesting topic. Given the progress of network technology the presented techniques may soon become highly relevant. Nevertheless, the work as presented here suffers from many issues, including:
- The abstract presents an idea out of the blue sky; the following basic things should be included: the setting and motivation for this work, the problem that is tackled, the state of the art and shortcomings, and the concrete contribution.
- The notion of Tactile CPS should be explained clearly and explicitly
- The discussion of related work is very poor. The presented work is not compared to the state of the art. Saying that existing work does not provide end-to-end support is not sufficient. The authors should compare the different aspects of their approach with the state of the art. Remarkable, the approach is compared to commercial products; the advantage seems primarily a matter of cost.
- The technical descriptions in section 2 (and the following sections) are difficult to grasp. The formulas are hardly explained. The authors use a very operational style of writing. The text reads as a report of the different engineering steps performed rather as a description of a novel approach.
- The text mixes design with concrete technology used. The latter can be added in a summary table (or be moved to an appendix).
- Several figures are not readable on black and white print, e.g. Figure 5 and 7.
- It is not clear what the use is of Figure 6 with the explanation.
- The evaluation is poorly reported. The text does not make clear what the authors want to evaluate, what method(s) they have used for it, what concrete setups have been used, how data was collected, etc. A lot of space could be saved for this by presenting results in the form of tables.
- The paper fails to clearly discuss the results. No threats to validity are presented.
- The text contains many typos that need to be corrected
