# TCPSbed (v1.0) 
A Modular Testbed for Tactile Internet based Cyber-Physical Systems

![architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48801729/76053561-9bfb7280-5f93-11ea-9f3b-4a4e6dd20639.png)

v1.0 (Description): Demonstrates basic testbed operation. Operator uses a USB mouse to control a robot simulated in VREP. Force feedback received from the robot side is printed at the ms-com terminal. Testbed components ms-com, srv, ss-com and embys-apps are run on different  hosts simulated in Mininet.

```diff
- Note: This is a demo version of TCPSbed. Only kinematic and haptic flows are supported in this version, support for other flows will be included soon. Only ms-embsys-app-mouseController and ss-embsys-vrep are supported in this version, support for other embsys-apps will be included soon.

# VREP Integration
VREP is a simulator platform for robots. For demonstration of the testbed we need to install VREP. First, download VREP v3.6.0 from https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads and extract it to a folder. Next, update the parameter 'vrep_path' in TCPSbed/runDirectory/config to correspond to the path of the executable 'vrep.sh'

# Demonstration-A: Control of a Remote-Side Robot

## Testbed Component Placement (in Mininet)
- ms-embsys-app-mouseController is run on ms-com
- ss-embsys-app-vrep is run on ss-com
- To edit the delay, bandwidth and traffic of the links, change the default settings in the file TCPSbed/mininetScript/settings

![gitTestbedComponentPlacement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48801729/75961647-65b4e900-5ee8-11ea-8c83-7cf4760f2347.png)

- To run the testbed, go to the folder mininetScript and run the command $sudo python mininetScript.py
- Wait for the xterm/windows ms-com, ss-com, srv, v-rep and ms-embsys-app-mouseController and ss-embsys-app-vrep to pop up
- Now use the mouse to control the PhantomX robot simulated in VREP
  - Right click the mouse to start the mouse control. Right click again to stop the mouse control
  - Mouse movements in X-Y direction is mapped to robot X-Y axis.  Y  movement  of  the  mouse,  while  the  left  button is pressed is mapped to the Z axis of the robot.
  - Use scroll wheel to open and close the pincher. 
- The force experienced by the robot when it hits an object is fedback to ms-com. The value is displayed in the ms-com terminal.

# Demonstration-B: Control of a Remote-Side Conveyor Belt

Follow the testbed component placement as in Demonstration-A. Edit the config file (TCPSbed/runDirectory/config) to replace the line "vrep_scene = "scenePhantomXGeneric.ttt" with "vrep_scene = "sceneConveyerBeltGeneric.ttt"

- To run the testbed, go to the folder mininetScript and run the command $sudo python mininetScript.py
- Wait for the xterm/windows ms-com, ss-com, srv, v-rep and ms-embsys-app-mouseController and ss-embsys-app-vrep to pop up
- Now use the mouse to control the PhantomX robot simulated in VREP
  - Right click the mouse to start the mouse control. Right click again to stop the mouse control
  - Use scroll wheel to change the direction and speed of the conveyor belt.
